# Rete.js Connection Path Example

This example demonstrates how to customize the paths of connections in a Rete.js node editor, allowing for more visually appealing and organized node graphs.

## Project Description

The visual appearance of connections between nodes significantly impacts the readability and organization of a node graph. This example shows how to implement custom connection path strategies in Rete.js, enabling various line styles like straight, curved, step-based, or custom algorithmic paths.

## Project Structure

```
├── public/        # Public assets
├── src/           # Source files
│   ├── App.tsx    # Main React component
│   ├── editor.ts  # Connection path implementation
│   ├── index.tsx  # Entry point
│   └── styles.css # Basic styling
├── package.json   # Project dependencies
└── tsconfig.json  # TypeScript configuration
```

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Features

- Multiple connection path styles
- Custom path calculation algorithms
- Dynamic path updates
- Path style selection interface
- Optimized path rendering
- Connection-specific styling
- Visual cueing through path styles

## Implementation

The example demonstrates how to:

1. Implement different connection path strategies
2. Create custom path calculation algorithms
3. Apply different styles to different connection types
4. Handle dynamic updates when nodes or connections change
5. Optimize path rendering for smooth performance
6. Customize path appearance with colors, patterns, and thickness
7. Allow runtime switching between path styles
