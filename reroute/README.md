# Rete.js Reroute Example

This example demonstrates how to implement connection rerouting functionality in a Rete.js node editor, allowing for cleaner and more organized node graphs.

## Project Description

As node graphs grow more complex, connections can become tangled and hard to follow. This example shows how to implement reroute points in Rete.js, which act as waypoints for connections, allowing users to create cleaner, more readable node graphs by organizing the connection paths.

## Project Structure

```
├── public/        # Public assets
├── src/           # Source files
│   ├── App.tsx    # Main React component
│   ├── editor.ts  # Reroute implementation
│   ├── reroute.ts # Reroute node component
│   ├── index.tsx  # Entry point
│   └── styles.css # Basic styling
├── package.json   # Project dependencies
└── tsconfig.json  # TypeScript configuration
```

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Features

- Connection waypoints
- Drag-and-drop reroute points
- Multiple input/output connections
- Path reorganization
- Simplified connection visualization
- Visual clarity for complex graphs
- Connection path control
- Seamless data flow

## Implementation

The example demonstrates how to:

1. Create specialized reroute nodes
2. Handle multiple connections through a single point
3. Maintain proper data flow through reroute points
4. Implement context menus for reroute creation
5. Allow dragging and positioning of reroute points
6. Preserve reroute points during serialization
7. Optimize rendering of complex connection paths
8. Handle reroute deletion without breaking connections
