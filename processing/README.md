# Rete.js Processing Examples

This directory contains examples of different processing engines in Rete.js:

1. **Data Flow**: Processing data using a data-flow paradigm where data flows through connected nodes
2. **Control Flow**: Processing with control flow where execution follows a specified flow control
3. **Hybrid Engine**: Combining both data-flow and control-flow paradigms

## Directory Structure

- `data-flow/`: Example of data-flow processing (use this, not the deprecated `dataflow/` directory)
- `control-flow/`: Example of control-flow processing
- `hybrid-engine/`: Example combining data-flow and control-flow processing

> **Note**: The `dataflow/` directory is deprecated and should be ignored. Please use the correctly named `data-flow/` directory instead.

These examples demonstrate how Rete.js can be used to build different types of computational graphs for various use cases.
