# Rete.js Processing Examples

This directory contains examples of different processing engines in Rete.js:

1. **Dataflow**: Processing data using a dataflow paradigm where data flows through connected nodes
2. **Control Flow**: Processing with control flow where execution follows a specified flow control
3. **Hybrid Engine**: Combining both dataflow and control flow paradigms

These examples demonstrate how Rete.js can be used to build different types of computational graphs for various use cases.
